ðŸ’Ž diamond: Curing Javascript Fatigue with Super-Static Rendering

Description
-----------

What if we took the fastest possible vanilla js for rendering and turned
that into a UI library? [Diamond](https://github.com/martypdx/diamond) is a 
new experimental library that does just that, resulting in performance as fast 
or faster than the same content rendered as a static document! (Think 10's of ms of
js time)

I will recap my research that shows how fast js and the DOM can be as well as learnings
on optimizing a rendering library. We'll look at code, run some profiles and talk about what to look for in 
stated performance numbers from ui libraries and frameworks.

Lastly, given a technology that renders this fast, I will: 
* posit the end of forced isomorphic js, immutability, and service-workers
* question efforts like Google's AMP, and
* speculate about the death of dom-diffing architectures.
